            <h2>Title: Intelligent State Estimation for Automated Model Maintenance and Real-time Optimizing Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Prof. Sachin Patwardhan</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Fidelity of dynamic and/or steady-state model used for making economic decisions in real-time optimization (RTO) or economic MPC (EMPC) is critical in achieving the desired economic benefits in the face of fast changing and uncertain market conditions. Since the model parameters/unmeasured disturbances keep changing with changes in the operating regime, online model update using recent operating data is essential for accruing the benefits of RTO or ENMPC over a long period of time. In practice, a large number of model parameters/unmeasured disturbances are susceptible to change and adjusting all of them without discrimination can result in overfitting and/or erroneous parameter estimates. Automating the task of finding the active subset of parameters/disturbances that need to be adjusted while carrying out the online model update can eliminate the need for an expert intervention for online maintenance of the model used for optimizing control. This can be achieved by developing an automated decision-making system that performs the active subset selection task by diagnosing the root cause(s) of departures from the normal behavior by analyzing transient data. This talk presents a brief review of intelligent state and parameter estimation approaches developed under the Bayesian framework for carrying out automated model maintenance. Abrupt or drifting model parameter/unmeasured disturbance changes, material or energy leaks, sensor/actuator biases or failures have been viewed as faults. Model based diagnosis of such abnormal behavior has been the focus of the first generation AI tools developed in the process control literature over last four decades. On this backdrop, we review a systematic framework that we have developed for fault diagnosis and identification (FDI) using the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) test in combination with a wide range of Bayesian estimators used for state estimation of linear and nonlinear systems. The proposed framework can isolate and identify single or multiple abrupt or drifting faults occurring simultaneously or sequentially in time. The fault information is subsequently used to modify the model so that the state estimator adapts to the new normal. Hypothesis tests are developed to stop the automated online model update when fault(s) saturate. Thus, the estimation of fault magnitudes is carried out only when triggered by FDI and the subset of parameters/faults that are being estimated online change with time. This allows us to overcome the fundamental limitations imposed by the observability conditions. When sensor or actuator failures are isolated, the measurement and/or control structures are modified to accommodate the failures. These intelligent estimators are further combined with integrated frequent RTO & adaptive nonlinear MPC and EMPC. The proposed real-time optimizing control approaches employ a single model to carry out multiple different tasks: abnormal behavior diagnosis, state and parameter estimation, fault tolerant adaptive predictive control, and real-time economic optimization. The proposed integrated approach can be viewed as a step toward developing an autonomous, flexible, and resilient closed-loop system.</p>

                <h2>Title: Key Technical aspects towards implementation of continuous pressurized water supply in India</h2>
                <p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Prashant Reddy</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Continuous water supply is standard in developed countries. Though not prevalent in developed countries, hundreds of millions of people worldwide continue to be served by intermittent water supply systems (IWSS). Transitioning to the continuous pressurized water supply is crucial due to the challenges posed by intermittent supply systems, such as high non-revenue water levels, contamination intrusion through leakages and ferrule points, air pockets formation during non-supply hours and inequitable water supply. Smart water technologies like monitoring pressure and flow using sensors and automatic control of pumps and valves are mandatory in continuous water supply systems (CWSS) to meet consumer demands, detect faults, and manage them effectively. Monitoring pressure traces of induced controlled fluid transients during either automatic valve or manual valve control is highly beneficial to detect leaks in pressurised single water pipelines. This paper aims to utilize the pressure traces that occurred during automatic valve control and manual valve control processes to characterize the leaks in pressurized single-water pipelines.</p>

                <p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Hemanth Taneru</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Crude preheaters of refineries contain two zones: the radiation zone and the convection zone. A set of 24 sensors are placed in these two zones: 16 in the radiation zone and 8 in the convection zone to monitor the heater performance. The rate at which the data is collected is 1 sample per minute. The data collected will be multivariate time series data. Vector Autoregressive model (VAR) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models were used to forecast the temperatures in the monitored locations. The goal is to use these forecasts to monitor and develop an early warning system to prevent anomalies in crude preheaters. LSTM model has outperformed the VAR model for the forecasts performed on the data.</p>

                <p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Pankaj Doshi</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Responding to the challenge of bringing lifechanging treatments and medicines with the utmost quality standards to the patients world-wide, the pharmaceutical industry is undergoing a transformational change to reduce the development timelines. In this presentation, we will examine the growing impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in enhancing development of novel medicines. Focusing on drug formulation design and process optimization, we will demonstrate how these innovative technologies can expedite and refine the development process. The presentation will include two case studies: one illustrating the application of ML in predicting the crystallization tendencies of organic compounds, and another presenting the development of an ML model for predicting the feed factor profile of powders in a gravimetric feeder, considering material properties and process parameters. This talk is aimed at highlighting the transformative capabilities of AI and ML in accelerating pharmaceutical development.</p>

                <h2>Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Control of Process Systems</h2>
                <p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Nabil Magbool Jan</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Reinforcement learning provides an automated decision-making framework that is suitable for real-time control of chemical processes despite uncertainties. Although there exists a wide variety of controllers available to achieve the desired control objectives, the concern for a control engineer while employing a model-based control strategy is that they require a physical model of the system. Further, the performance of the controller strongly depends on the accuracy of the mathematical model. Although deriving an accurate mathematical model is possible while dealing with simple systems, it becomes a herculean task when it comes to complex systems. Moreover, model-based process control may require frequent re-identification of the model to account for the change in process conditions. This talk will focus on developing deep reinforcement learning-based control strategy for chemical processes. More specifically, I will discuss two deep reinforcement learning based controllers for control of reactor systems. The first controller is based on the Deep Q network (DQN) algorithm which is a value-based reinforcement learning algorithm that deals with continuous states and discrete actions. The second controller that we developed is based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm which is a policy-based actor-critic algorithm that can deal with continuous states and actions. We demonstrate the tracking performance of the deep RL controllers using benchmark reactor systems. Furthermore, I will discuss the challenges involved in the practical implementation of deep reinforcement learning controllers.</p>

                <h2>Title: Static to Dynamic Regression, Identification to Causal Discovery, From Asymmetry to Symmetry: PCA-based approaches</h2>
                <p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Arun K Tangirala</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Regression, identification and causal discovery problems are associated with discovering relations among variables from their measurements. A central tool that powerfully addresses these problems in linear processes is the PCA (SVD). This talk presents a class of PCA-based approaches to optimally (effectively) identify linear models from erroneous measurements for processes that operate under steady-state and dynamic conditions. Specifically, iterative and dynamic iterative PCA methods are presented to solve these so-called errors-in-variables ID problems that are symmetric counterparts of the standard (asymmetric) identification problems. Subsequently, a DIPCA-based approach to solving the causal discovery problem for linear dynamical deterministic-plus-stochastic systems. Underlying these problems is that of moving from a world of asymmetry to symmetry (in the error and variable space). The talk culminates in a unified methodology to handle both classes of problems. These works emerge from over a decade-long active collaboration with Prof. Shankar Narasimhan.</p>

                <h2>Title: Chemometrics and Data Science Applications in Shell</h2>
                <p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Resmi Suresh, Shell</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Chemometrics is the science of relating measurements made on a chemical system to the state of the system via application of mathematical or statistical or data-driven algorithms. This talk will highlight various projects undertaken by Shell's chemometrics and digital chemistry team, showcasing how we derive value from chemical data by integrating chemometrics, data-driven models, and optimization techniques.</p>
                <p>One significant challenge in our lubricant business is characterizing degradation in lubricants and immersion coolants. By design of experiments and analyzing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra obtained from the experiments, we identified the optimal operational regime for EIS, enabling maximum insights into contaminants and ageing processes. In the LNG sector, accurate estimation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and monitoring leaks from equipment are major concerns. We developed various data-driven algorithms to estimate leaks and conducted statistical analyses to compare their effectiveness. For the slow process of effluent treatment, we created data-driven models to forecast key performance indicators and used these models to devise operational strategies that help control the ideal food-to-mass ratio. Additionally, as part of our business-agnostic research, we are developing algorithms to detect and diagnose faults in control loops using process data. The transformative impact of chemometrics and data science on Shell's operations and their importance in driving innovation and sustainability across various sectors is highlighted in this talk.</p>

                <h2>Title: Framework for characterization and monitoring of difficult-to-measure species in complex chemical systems</h2>
                <p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Ravikanth Mukku</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Chemical speciation calculation is used for identification and quantification of the various species, forms or phases in which an element occurs at thermodynamic equilibrium. Chemical speciation calculation is highly essential in areas such as environmental modeling, phase equilibria calculations, developing reactive transport models used for transport modeling of contaminants (heavy metals, radioactive elements etc.), contaminants modeling in industrial wastes, ground water monitoring, geochemical models for calculation of composition of natural water, dissolution of rocks, formation of minerals, precipitation and solubility studies, surface complexation modeling, CO2 sequestration modeling, and climate change reactive transport models etc. Since most of the species formed in these systems are not easily measurable, chemical speciation calculation plays a vital role to detect, quantify and monitor specific chemical species, even at very low concentrations, enabling improved chemical process understanding and control. However, there are several challenges in chemical speciation calculation due to the highly non-linear nature of the governing equations being solved for the systems leading to non-convergence, initial guess sensitivity and consequently requiring a large number of iterations. This talk aims at highlighting the challenges in chemical speciation calculations of complex systems. Addressing these challenges, a framework for chemical speciation calculation is presented which is fast and robust. The proposed framework is effective, inexpensive and relatively simple for characterization and continuous monitoring of difficult-to-measure species in complex chemical systems.</p>

                <h2>Title: Systems approach to implementing process changes</h2>
                <p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Lakshmi V</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Traditional approaches to process and utility modifications often assume fixed steam and power prices. However, making strategic decisionsâ€”such as project prioritization, roadmap development, and budget allocationâ€”requires a comprehensive understanding of the economic impact of these choices.
                To address this, a methodology that captures the interactions between process and utility systems was implemented to evaluate the merger of a refinery and petrochemical complex. This approach provides a visual framework for assessing various configurations and quantifying their economic impact, enabling more informed and strategic decision-making.</p>

                <h2>Title: Autoencoders with ordered variance: Static and state-space models</h2>
                <p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Mani Bhushan</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Knowledge of relationships, often nonlinear, amongst process variables is a key requirement for process optimization and model based control. In the current work, we propose autoencoder based data-driven approaches for identifying both static (steady state), and dynamic (state-space form) nonlinear relationships amongst process variables in an unsupervised setting. The relationships are discovered by ordering the encoder outputs by decreasing variance. Examples related to real-time optimization, model predictive control and state estimation, are discussed to demonstrate the utility of the approaches.</p>
